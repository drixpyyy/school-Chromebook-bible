faster loading speeds, basically makes your school chromebook a personal chromebook allowing you to delete anything you want including admin extensions etc, % of working is a rough estimate of 64%, cannot and wont break your chromebook unlike the "developer mode" bypassing tutorials that have a 100% chance of breaking your school laptop and i had to get 2 new laptops because of "developer mode" bypasses, got paid to do this on peoples chromebooks i didint wanna get told on so i didint wanna make it expensive as flurq and someone get mad cause they couldnt buy it and everyone coud so i made it 5 cents per laptop ðŸ˜Ÿ

slower loading speeds(really slow if your using rammerhead, if you use another proxy like nebula, interstellar, e.g, it will be faster but rammerhead lets you make your own links making it unblocked, i recommend going to the domain your going to use on your chromebook and hosting/making the website on your home computer(free) and i sold websites but someone used it to watch corn and told on me when he got caught

WARNING!!!: DO NOT SELL PROXIES OR METHODS/FLEX THAT YOU CAN GO ON UNBLOCKED SITES/DELETE ADMIN EXTENSIONS BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE ANNOYING BASTARDS AND WILL TELL ON YOU IF YOU DONT TELL THEM THE METHOD AND IF YOU TELL THEM TO NOT TELL ANYONE THEY WILL 100% TELL EVERYONE OR A FRIEND GROUP WHICH LEADS INTO ANOTHER FRIEND GROUP THEN ANOTHER ETC. !!!TILL YOU GET CAUGHT!!! ONLY SHARE WITH FRIENDS OF 1 YEAR + AND FAMILY(like play a fortnite match with them during a class/lunch or roblox and try your absolute best to not show anyone else)


Bookmarklets Hub:
https://github.com/Goldenium11/school-bookmarklets

if you don't know how to use bookmarklets you basically create a bookmark at paste in the code as the URL and press it on any website and the bookmarklet wont redirect you to the link but will run the JavaScript code that you put in it


supposedly turns your chromebook(has options for Windows laptops and macOS laptops) into dev-mode(not the one i was talking about in "SWAMP METHOD" this is different): https://github.com/Mrepic33/DevMode_SchoolCheats
